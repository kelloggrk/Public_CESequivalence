Abstracting from transfers, I focus on the long-run efficiency gains from adopting RTP in a competitive electricity market. Using simple simulations with realistic parameters, I demonstrate that the magnitude of efficiency gains from RTP is likely to be significant even if demand shows very little elasticity. I also show that Òtime-of-useÓ pricing, a simple peak and off-peak pricing system, is likely to capture a very small share of the efficiency gains that RTP offers.},

Using a household-level, discrete-continuous model of natural gas demand, we estimate that the allocative cost in this market averaged $3.6 billion annually, nearly tripling previous estimates of the net welfare loss to U.S. consumers.},

For any uniform price unequal to marginal cost, there is a nonlinear outlay schedule that is preferred by each consumer and that yields greater vendor profit. In fact, Pareto efficiency requires an outlay schedule that offers the largest consumer a marginal price equal to marginal cost. A nonlinear outlay schedule can only be effective if the product cannot be readily traded among consumers and if the vendor can monitor individuals' total purchases. Many public utilities meet these criteria.},

This creates a price differential between services that are identical for the consumer and generates network externalities despite network interconnection.

Optimal pricing and operating policies are derived where the technology fulfills certain convexity conditions. The approach shows the efficiency of peak load pricing under stochastic demand conditions which contrasts with the results of earlier writers. Bounds on prices are derived. Comparisons with the deterministic demand case are made, and a numerical example shows the effects of changes in various parameters on prices and capacity.},

This paper develops a model for evaluating the effects of alternative tariff designs on electricity use. The model concurrently addresses several interrelated difficulties posed by nonlinear pricing, heterogeneity in consumer price sensitivity, and consumption aggregation over appliances and time. We estimate the model using extensive data for a representative sample of 1300 California households. The results imply a strikingly skewed distribution of household electricity price elasticities in the population, with a small fraction of households accounting for most aggregate demand response. We then estimate the aggregate and distributional consequences of recent tariff structure changes in California, the consumption effects of which have been the subject of considerable debate.

This article presents new evidence on how price changes and conservation appeals affect energy consumption, using household-level data from California's energy crisis during 2000 and 2001. The evidence indicates that when policymakers cap energy prices following market shocks, they preclude substantial-and quite rapid-reductions in energy use. The data also reveal that conservation appeals and informational programs can produce sustained reductions in energy demand.},

 abstract = {This paper sets out a framework to evaluate the welfare impacts of residential energy efficiency programs in the presence of imperfect information, behavioral biases, and externalities, then estimates key parameters using a 100,000-household field experiment. Several results run counter to conventional wisdom: we find no evidence of informational or behavioral failures thought to reduce program participation, there are large unobserved benefits and costs that traditional evaluations miss, and realized energy savings are only 58 percent of predictions. In the context of the model, the two programs we study reduce social welfare by $0.18 per subsidy dollar spent, both because subsidies are not well-calibrated to estimated externality damages and because of self-selection induced by subsidies that attract households whose participation generates low social value. However, the model predicts that perfectly calibrated subsidies would increase welfare by \$2.53 per subsidy dollar, revealing the potential of energy efficiency programs.},

Their predictions seem rigidly grounded on tacit assumptions that utilities are inert in responding to a more competitive environment. It is more likely utilities will work with their regulators to avoid serious financial problems while promoting efficient competition that serves the public interest.},

abstract = {Retail real-time pricing (RTP) of electricity Ð retail pricing that changes hourly to reflect the changing supply/demand balance Ð is very appealing to economists because it Òsends the right price signals.Ó Economic efficiency gains from RTP, however, are often confused with the short-term wealth transfers from producers to consumers that RTP can create. Abstracting from transfers, I focus on the long-run efficiency gains from adopting RTP in a competitive electricity market. Using simple simulations with realistic parameters, I demonstrate that the magnitude of efficiency gains from RTP is likely to be significant even if demand shows very little elasticity. I also show that Òtime-of-useÓ pricing, a simple peak and off-peak pricing system, is likely to capture a very small share of the efficiency gains that RTP offers.},

For any uniform price unequal to marginal cost, there is a nonlinear outlay schedule that is preferred by each consumer and that yields greater vendor profit. In fact, Pareto efficiency requires an outlay schedule that offers the largest consumer a marginal price equal to marginal cost. A nonlinear outlay schedule can only be effective if the product cannot be readily traded among consumers and if the vendor can monitor individuals' total purchases. Many public utilities meet these criteria.},

This creates a price differential between services that are identical for the consumer and generates network externalities despite network interconnection. We show that in both the mature and entry phases of the industry, the nature of competition is substantially affected by such price discrimination.},

Optimal pricing and operating policies are derived where the technology fulfills certain convexity conditions. The approach shows the efficiency of peak load pricing under stochastic demand conditions which contrasts with the results of earlier writers. Bounds on prices are derived. Comparisons with the deterministic demand case are made, and a numerical example shows the effects of changes in various parameters on prices and capacity.},

This paper develops a model for evaluating the effects of alternative tariff designs on electricity use. The model concurrently addresses several interrelated difficulties posed by nonlinear pricing, heterogeneity in consumer price sensitivity, and consumption aggregation over appliances and time. We estimate the model using extensive data for a representative sample of 1300 California households. The results imply a strikingly skewed distribution of household electricity price elasticities in the population, with a small fraction of households accounting for most aggregate demand response. We then estimate the aggregate and distributional consequences of recent tariff structure changes in California, the consumption effects of which have been the subject of considerable debate.

This article presents new evidence on how price changes and conservation appeals affect energy consumption, using household-level data from California's energy crisis during 2000 and 2001. The evidence indicates that when policymakers cap energy prices following market shocks, they preclude substantial-and quite rapid-reductions in energy use. The data also reveal that conservation appeals and informational programs can produce sustained reductions in energy demand.},

Several results run counter to conventional wisdom: we find no evidence of informational or behavioral failures thought to reduce program participation, there are large unobserved benefits and costs that traditional evaluations miss, and realized energy savings are only 58 percent of predictions. In the context of the model, the two programs we study reduce social welfare by $0.18 per subsidy dollar spent, both because subsidies are not well-calibrated to estimated externality damages and because of self-selection induced by subsidies that attract households whose participation generates low social value. However, the model predicts that perfectly calibrated subsidies would increase welfare by \$2.53 per subsidy dollar, revealing the potential of energy efficiency programs.},
